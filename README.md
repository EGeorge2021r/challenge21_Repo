# challenge21_Repo
A project to develop a monetary system for the new Mars colony. 

## User Story
Role: Martian Aerospace Agency Fintech Project Lead

Goal: To develop a monetary system for the new Mars colony based on blockchain technology, and to define a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin. (“Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese.)

Reason: KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. also launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin

## Requirements
1. Create a smart contract that defines KaseiCoin as an ERC-20 token

2. Define the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract

3. Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract

4. Deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.

5. Optional: Eextend the crowdsale contract to enhance its functionality by Using OpenZeppelin

## Libraries and dependencies
The following libraries and dependencies were deployed:
- Remix IDE
- Ganache
-
